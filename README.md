# Reserch about combos

## What is a combo?

The term "combo" is an abreviation of "combination". It can have various meanings, but the focus of this reserch is the meaning given mostly by games that imply hand on hand combat, such as Fighting games, Beat em ups and Hack and
Slash games. 

**A combo is an unescapable combination of attacks**

## Why are combos a good addition 

There are three basic reasons why combos make for a good playing experience:

- They give the player a feeling of superiority over their enemies, as while preforming a combo, most of the time there is nothing that the opponent can do.

- There is a certain visual appeal in seeing a fighter perform flashy combinations of attacks.

- Combos make the player feel skillful, as they imply a lot of fast and powerful attacks. If the combo itself is difficult to execute, the effect is increased
